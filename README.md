# StudentConnect
Self Learning React and .Net to build this personal project. I want to create a social media app for students from different universities or countries to interact with each other.

As a student, I want to connect with students from my university and other universities to hang out, work together towards our career development or simply trade our items. When I wanted to look for people to attend events together, there are so many Facebook groups out there and it is difficult to identify a good group with active members without spams. When my friends wanted to sell their stuff to other students at a cheap price, they didn't know where to post other than Facebook groups which are not really active. University students need a place to connect outside their universities!
