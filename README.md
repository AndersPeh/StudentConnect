# StudentConnect

## Connecting Students Across Campuses

**StudentConnect** is a personal project born from a passion for learning React and .NET, and a desire to solve a real-world problem for students. This social media application aims to be a dedicated platform for students from diverse universities to connect, collaborate, and interact.

### The Challenge for Students Today

As a student, I've experienced firsthand the difficulties in connecting with peers beyond my immediate circles for various activities:

*   **Finding Event Buddies:** Navigating numerous, often cluttered and spam-filled Facebook groups to find people for events is a hassle. It's hard to find active groups with genuine members.
*   **Collaborating on Career Development:** Students are often looking for peers to work on projects, study together, or share career advice, but a centralized platform for this is missing.
*   **Trading and Selling Items:** When friends want to sell textbooks, furniture, or other items to fellow students at reasonable prices, they struggle to find an effective, targeted marketplace beyond inactive social media groups.

The core issue is clear: **University students need a dedicated, trustworthy, and engaging space to connect with others, both within their own university and with students from other institutions.**

### My Solution: StudentConnect

StudentConnect aims to be that space! It's being built to provide a focused environment where students can:

*   **Current Focus:** Hang Out & Network- Organise or join meetups, study groups, or social gatherings.
*   Upcoming: Career Growth- Collaborate on projects, share internship opportunities, and support each other's professional development.
*   Upcoming: Student Marketplace- A safe and easy way to buy, sell, or trade items with other students.
